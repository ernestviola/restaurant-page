## Lessons
In this assignment I tried pushing myself a bit with trying to create some responsive design. I noticed it's quite difficult without media queries so I'm looking forward to that lesson. I also tried doing something fancy with the nav and I was disappointed to see that mobile looks vastly different.

This was also the first time using webpack and it kind of reminds me of React.
